    "bio":"I am an athlete at heart, with an entrepreneurial spirit, a knack for online security, and a passion for coding. Coming up just short of finishing my degree by 2 online courses, I decided to just bask in the glory of being finished with lectures and have left to travel Southeast Asia for a year. I am using this time to gain some world experience, train in Muay Thai, and hone my craft on some personal projects. Upon my return to Canada I hope to begin a web development or software engineering career while I finish off my degree.",

Here I took my Bachelors of Computer Science with a Software Engineering Specialty and achieved a much more thorough education in the underlying theory, concepts, and science behind more complex programming. It was here that I discovered my passion for scalable application programming (web and mobile), the security behind computer and application systems, and found that I have a knack for understanding complex algorithms."

While here, I studied Computer Systems Technology, a 2 year lead-in to a Bachelors of Computer Science. This was a very hands-on experience focused more on building projects than general theory. Here I built database structures for fictional companies, created small video games, hand-coded Space Invaders from scratch in Assembly Language, built and coded an Arduino Robot to navigate obstacle courses, a lot of Java and C++ programming for data structures, and much more."
