    "bio":"I am an athlete at heart, with an entrepreneurial spirit, a knack for online security, and a passion for coding. Coming up just short of finishing my degree by 2 online courses, I decided to just bask in the glory of being finished with lectures and have left to travel Southeast Asia for a year. I am using this time to gain some world experience, train in Muay Thai, and hone my craft on some personal projects. Upon my return to Canada I hope to begin a web development or software engineering career while I finish off my degree.",

Here I took my Bachelors of Computer Science with a Software Engineering Specialty and achieved a much more thorough education in the underlying theory, concepts, and science behind more complex programming. It was here that I discovered my passion for scalable application programming (web and mobile), the security behind computer and application systems, and found that I have a knack for understanding complex algorithms."

While here, I studied Computer Systems Technology, a 2 year lead-in to a Bachelors of Computer Science. This was a very hands-on experience focused more on building projects than general theory. Here I built database structures for fictional companies, created small video games, hand-coded Space Invaders from scratch in Assembly Language, built and coded an Arduino Robot to navigate obstacle courses, a lot of Java and C++ programming for data structures, and much more."

During my time here I have worked in all roles involved in the Water and Sewer Department, with the exception of equipment operating. I worked as a water meter technician programming the meters in people's homes. I worked in location, excavation, installation and repair of water and sewer lines. I learned how to install, dismantle, troubleshoot, and repair the most popular models of fire hydrants. \n\nWhile working for the Water Treatment and Distribution Department, and alongside one partner, we led the first Uni-Directional Flow program our city has done in years. This requires a thorough understanding of the city's water grid to selectively force excessive pressure through a water line in order to clean it. This must be done in a specific order for every line in the city.   "
